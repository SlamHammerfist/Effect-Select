# Effect Select

_A schema-binding invocation for Active Effects in DND5E._

Effect Select empowers effect authors with intelligent dropdowns and recursive bonus logic. It injects a searchable, grouped key selector into Active Effect configuration and extends `.all` bonuses across every applicable domain ‚Äî from attacks and damage to saves, checks, skills, tools, traits, and more.

## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è **Schema-Aware Extensibility**  
  Supports movement, AC, HP, traits, spell DCs, ability saves/checks, skills, and tools ‚Äî all patched cleanly.

  Core logic split into `allBonuses.js` for maintainability and reuse.
