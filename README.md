# 🪄 Effect Select

_A schema-binding invocation for Active Effects in DND5E._

Effect Select empowers effect authors with intelligent dropdowns and recursive bonus logic. It injects a searchable, grouped key selector into Active Effect configuration and extends `.all` bonuses across every applicable domain — from attacks and damage to saves, checks, skills, tools, traits, and more.
